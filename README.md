# Dataset

Since I manually created the dataset, all of the data is currently in CSV format for easy export from Google Sheets. The data comes from a few sources, but mainly was informed by the [Metal Gear Wiki](https://metalgear.fandom.com/wiki/Metal_Gear_Wiki) and the [Death Stranding Wiki](https://deathstranding.fandom.com/wiki/Death_Stranding_Wiki).

Right now, it only has data from MGS1, MGS2, MGS3, and Death Stranding, with the rest of the canon Metal Gear games and Snatcher coming soon!
